# Hydraulic-Channel-Flow-Analysis-HEC-RAS-Standard-Step-Method
Modeled trapezoidal–rectangular channel flow (Q=10 m³/s) using Manning’s equation, HEC-RAS, and the standard-step method. Computed normal/critical depths, water surface, and energy grade lines; validated analytical results with HEC-RAS simulations.
